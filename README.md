TO PLAY A MOVE:
First type the letter and number coordinate of the piece you want to move. (coordinates shown on the board)
Then type the letter and number coordinate of where you want the piece to move.

For example:
Typing "a2a4" at the start of the game will move the pawn at "a2" to the empty space at "a4".
Applies to special moves also (last pair of coordinates should still be where you want the piece to go)

Chess moves will be applied.
